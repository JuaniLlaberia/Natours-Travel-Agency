## Natours.io Travel Agency
My first back-end focused project. As part of the ['Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2023'](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/)' course, we built our own API and server-side rendered front-end website. The idea in this project was to combine all the knowledge we adquired during the course and create a real world application. From the endpoints, authentification and modern UI, Natours has it all.
First, we built the API using Node.js with the help of express.js and MongoDB for storing our data. Eventhough some endpoints are protected to users or administrators, anyone can create a new account in order to book tours. There are some features that haven't been implemented in the UI such as writting reviews, creating tours, but API functionality is already there. 
In addition we used server-side rendering for the UI using PUG templates as an alternative to regular HTML.

Also Stripe has been implemented in TEST mode in order to emulate how it would work in the real application.
